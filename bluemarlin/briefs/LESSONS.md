## Brief 039 — Capacity-aware booking with soft holds
**Date:** 2026-03-08

Two review cycles were needed: (1) `{N}` inside an f-string in the prompt raises `NameError` — always use `{{N}}` for literal braces inside Python f-strings in marina_agent.py prompt sections; (2) `create_soft_hold` using raw `sqlite3.connect()` bypasses `_get_conn()`'s table creation — always route through `_get_conn()` for schema guarantees, then set `isolation_level = None` if manual transaction control is needed. Brief reviewer caught both before execution; test suite cleanly validated all 8 scenarios including concurrent race.
